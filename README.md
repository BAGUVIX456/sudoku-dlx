This is a simple CLI application that uses Prof. Donald Knuth's [Algorithm DLX](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047) to find all the solutions of a given sudoku puzzle. The blueprint to reduce a sudoku puzzle into an exact cover problem that can be worked upon by DLX was obtained from [this](https://www.kth.se/social/files/58861771f276547fe1dbf8d1/HLaestanderMHarrysson_dkand14.pdf) paper.

To use this application, one can either :
1. Clone this repository and compile it themselves, or
2. Download the executable from the Releases tab for the appropriate OS and run it from a command line terminal of your choice.
